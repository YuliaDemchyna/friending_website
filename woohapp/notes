ABOUT FORMS
form is a class, they typically handle what kind of fileds will be displayed in html
it validaits it, and you can use the instance to display the fields in html
and if use model form, it also gets methods to control creation and updated to the model
so i would pass a form as a variable(can ofc be named whatever) in templates to display it

when you create a model or update - the method save() is executed


ABOUT QUERYSTRINGS
Structure: A query string starts with a question mark (?) and is followed by key-value pairs.
Each pair is separated by an ampersand (&). Fe: ?key1=value1&key2=value2.

Usage in URLs: Query strings are appended to the end of a URL.
They are used after the domain and path of the URL.
For instance, http://example.com/page?param=value.

Data Transmission: They transmit data to the server as part of a GET request. This data can be used by the server

Encoding: Characters in query strings are URL-encoded.
Spaces are replaced with + or %20,
and special characters are encoded with % followed by two hexadecimal digits.
